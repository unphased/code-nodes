# Project snapshot

This repo hosts two ComfyUI custom nodes (Shell Code + Python Code) plus a small
front-end helper that manages their widgets. The Python node offers dynamic
input slots and an optional "load script from file" workflow; anything you touch
should keep that experience intact but details can be picked up from the source.
